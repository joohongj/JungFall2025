                <h1>What is Polyozellus atrolazulinus?</h1>
                <div class="mainphoto"><img src="images/01.webp"></div>
                <p>Polyozellus is a fungal genus in the family Thelephoraceae, a grouping of mushrooms known
                    collectively as the leathery earthfans. Previously considered a monotypic genus, it now contains the
                    Polyozellus multiplex species complex. The genus name is derived from the Greek poly meaning many,
                    and oz, meaning branch. It is commonly known as the blue chanterelle, the clustered blue
                    chanterelle, bluefan,[1] or, in Alaska, the black chanterelle. The distinctive fruit body of this
                    species comprises blue- to purple-colored clusters of vase- or spoon-shaped caps with veiny wrinkles
                    on the undersurface that run down the length of the stem.

                    Polyozellus has had a varied taxonomic history and has been reclassified several times at both the
                    family and genus level. The range of Polyozellus includes North America and eastern Asia, where it
                    grows on the ground of coniferous forests, usually under spruce and fir trees. It contains edible
                    species, and has been harvested for commercial purposes.

                <h1>Habitat and distribution</h1>
                <p>Polyozellus grows in coniferous woods under spruce and fir,[19] and more frequently at higher
                    elevations.[16] It is most often encountered in summer and fall.[20]

                    <br>
                    This genus is northern and alpine in distribution, and rarely encountered. Collections have been
                    made in the United States (including Maine, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska), Canada
                    (Quebec and British Columbia),[5][9][21][22] China,[23] Japan, and Korea.[24] The disjunct
                    distribution of the genus in North America and East Asia has been noted to occur in a number of
                    other fungal species as well.[25] In the American Pacific Northwest, the genus is found in September
                    and October.[26] It is also found in the Queen Charlotte Islands (off the northern Pacific coast of
                    Canada), where it is commercially harvested.
