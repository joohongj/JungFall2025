                <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p>The first published description of the species was written by botanist Lucien M. Underwood in 1899,
                    based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of Mount Desert, Maine. Although he called
                    the new species a Cantharellus, he noted that "the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit
                    might well form a distinct genus since it has little in common with Cantharellus except its
                    fold-like gills."[2] In 1910, William Murrill transferred it to the new genus Polyozellus; Murrill
                    thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it
                    being separated from Cantharellus species, which have simpler stem structures.[3] In 1920, specimens
                    from a Japanese collection compiled by A. Yasuda were sent to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, who
                    believed the fungus to be a new species and named it Phyllocarbon yasudai.</p>
                <p>No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in Quebec,
                    Canada.[5] The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus Polyozellus to be superfluous, pointed out
                    that the compound fruit bodies and the wrinkled hymenium were instead consistent with the genus
                    Craterellus.[6] In 1939, American mycologist Lee Oras Overholts, in a letter to the journal
                    Mycologia, opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by Calvin Henry
                    Kauffman, who made notes and photos of the species collected in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and
                    Colorado, and in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon.[7] Kauffman believed the species to
                    be merely "a very extreme growth condition" of Cantharellus clavatus (now known as Gomphus clavatus)
                    and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus Craterellus.[8]
                    Mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Elizabeth Eaton Morse, in their 1947 publication on Cantharellus
                    species in the United States, placed the species in a new section Polyozellus, but did not separate
                    it from the genus Cantharellus; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of Polyozellus as
                    the small, roughened, hyaline spores and the color change of the flesh in potassium hydroxide
                    solution, adding that "the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant
                    excluding the species."[9]</p>
                <p>In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki took into consideration differences in spore characteristics: species in the
                    genus Cantharellus were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and
                    tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like Polyozellus; however, these spore
                    characteristics were common in species in the family Thelephoraceae (Cantharellus belongs in a
                    different family, the Cantharellaceae). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the
                    Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), and the
                    presence of thelephoric acid, a mushroom pigment common in the family. Taken together, these factors
                    led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae.[10] The suggested family-level taxonomical
                    change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it
                    Thelephora multiplex.[11]

                    In 2017, researchers from eastern Europe and North America collaborated on a molecular phylogeny of
                    the previously monotypic Polyozellus multiplex.[12] They determined that Polyozellus contains five
                    species that are distinguished by spore size and geographic region: the small-spored P. multiplex
                    and P. atrolazulinus and the large-spored P. mariae, P. marymargaretae, and P. purpureoniger. As of
                    2022, both Index Fungorum[13] and MycoBank[14] list Polyozellus as being within the family
                    Thelephoraceae, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery earthfans.[15]

                    Common names for this genus include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle.[16] In
                    Alaska, where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black
                    chanterelle,[17] although this name is shared with some Craterellus species.</p>
