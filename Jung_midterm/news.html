			<h2>Former Vice President Dick Cheney dead at 84
			</h2><img src="images/news03.png">
			<p><span>(NPR)</span> Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who extolled the power of the presidency, died
				Monday at the age
				of
				84, his family said in a statement.

				The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said.

				"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and
				to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing," the statement said. "We are grateful
				beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved
				and been loved by this noble giant of a man."

				There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day
				play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in
				Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company
				in his new home state of Wyoming; toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an
				inauspicious young adulthood. (...)</p>

			<h2>A leaked video, a frantic search, and the top military lawyer: What to know about the scandal rocking

			<p><span>(CNN)</span> Jerusalem
				—
				Less than a week ago, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the Israeli military’s top lawyer, tasked
				with enforcing the rule of law within the nation’s armed forces.

				Now, she is under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the
				alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in a notorious Israeli military prison.

				A longstanding target of Israel’s right-wing, Tomer-Yerushalmi’s rapid fall has quickly emerged as a
				national scandal, overshadowing the video at the center of the case. The affair dates back to July 2024,
				when legal authorities in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened an investigation into soldiers who were
				allegedly shown sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza war as some two
				dozen other detainees lay face-down nearby at the Sde Teiman military prison. (...)

			<h2>Zohran Mamdani elected mayor of New York on winning night for Democrats
			</h2><img src="images/news07.avif">
			<p><span>(The Guardian)</span> Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani was elected on Tuesday as the 111th mayor
				of New York City, defeating the former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and
				making history as the city’s first Muslim mayor.

				The 34-year-old democratic socialist and state assembly member from Queens, secured victory with more
				than 50% of the vote. Cuomo, 67, finished second with just over 40%, while Republican candidate Curtis
				Sliwa received just over 7% of the vote.

				Mamdani’s historic victory was announced amid a slew of Democratic wins across the country, with
				Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger becoming Virginia’s first female governor, Mikie Sherrill defeating her
				Trump-backed gubernatorial opponent in New Jersey, and California voting for Gavin Newsom’s push for
				redistricting maps that would yield five new congressional seats for the party.

				The crowd at Mamdani’s election night party at the Brooklyn Paramount in downtown Brooklyn erupted after
				the Associated Press called the race in his favor. People cheered and hugged each other at the news.

			<h2>The Stubborn Myth of the Literary Genius</h2>
			<img src="images/news05.avif">
			<p><span>(The Atlantic)</span> If you close your eyes and picture an artistic genius, chances are that the
				portrait will
				be framed by a Romantic ideal that took shape 200 years ago: an artist dedicated solely to his (almost
				always his) muse and transgressive appetites, breaking his era’s rules both moral and artistic, remaking
				society with his art. But this vision of genius is a poor fit for many great artists, and it tends to
				obscure what makes them and their work special. Take William Shakespeare, who is often portrayed as a
				carouser, downing pints while exchanging barbs with his fellow writers, cheating on his wife with both
				men and women, passionately engaging his quill to reimagine the very nature of the (...)

			<h2>A Fox News report prompted Trump to post about Nigeria, setting off White House scramble</h2>
			<img src="images/news06.avif">
			<p><span>(NBC NEWS)</span> By Gabe Gutierrez, Yamiche Alcindor, Gordon Lubold, Courtney Kube, Dan De Luce
				and Abigail Williams
				WASHINGTON — A Fox News report prompted President Donald Trump to call out Nigeria over the killing of
				Christians and then threaten military action, setting off a scramble in the White House over the
				weekend, according to multiple U.S. officials.

				It’s still unclear what — if anything — the administration will do to counter Islamic militants in
				Nigeria, but precision drone strikes are among the preliminary options being considered, two U.S.
				officials said.

				A White House spokesperson declined Monday to offer any details on the plans under consideration.

				“At President Trump’s direction, the administration is planning options for possible action to stop the
				killing of Christians in Nigeria," the spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said in a statement. "Any announcements
				will come from the President directly. Trump's first social media post on Nigeria came Friday night
				after he watched a Fox News report on violence in the West African nation, two administration officials
				said. The president asked his staff for more information about the situation and, shortly after,
				declared in a Truth Social post that he was designating Nigeria a "country of particular concern" over
				its failure to, in his words, stop the "mass slaughter" of (...)
